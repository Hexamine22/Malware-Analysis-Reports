# Automatic API resolving

Script is broken on samples other than this one :/. You can change the values hex_values list in BuildsExportsUsedByLockbit to the first value in each hash table to make it work.
Change xor key in BuildExportsUsedByLockbit.py and run it to generate a JSON file containing all the export names. Next, run LockbitBlackApiResolve.py in IDA and use ParseAPIHashTable function with the JSON file as its first argument, and address of function that resolves apis from a hashtable as the 2nd argument.
Change xor key in LockbitBlackApiResolve.py->APIName() function to the one used in your sample
